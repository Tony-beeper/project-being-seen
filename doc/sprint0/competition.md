1.  **GoFundMe ([https://www.gofundme.com/](https://www.gofundme.com/))**
    GoFundMe is an online fundraising platform that allows users to raise money for their needs (celebrations, medical expenses, poverty-related circumstances, etc.). It is similar in the sense that donors can donate towards users; however:

- GoFundMe has no control over how a particular person spends their money. In contrast, Being Seen has a community of merchants who provide services that will specifically benefit the homeless youth population. For instance, merchants can post their educational services to the platform for youths to purchase with donations (education is a crucial step that addresses homelessness and elevates youth out of the vicious cycle of homelessness).
- GoFundMe is a general purpose site for all types of users who require fundraising whereas Being Seen addresses only the homeless youth population as a community. GoFundMe would not consider only focusing on the homeless youth since it will reduce their reach and bottom line (GoFundMe is a for-profit organization).

2.  **Greater Change ([https://www.greaterchange.co.uk/](https://www.greaterchange.co.uk/))**
    Greater Change is a non-profit organization that helps elevate individuals out of homelessness. They are similar in the sense that donors can donate towards homeless individuals, money raised is spent towards services that will help bring the individual out of poverty, etc. However:

- Greater Change works more individually with the homeless users of their platform. They work with them, help them create a strategic plan, spend the money on their behalf, and promote specific individuals to donors on their platform. Being Seen however, is simply a middle man that seeks to connect donors to homeless youth and the homeless youth to services/products that will help free them from homelessness.
- Greater Change has only UK locations and does not appear to be working with individuals outside their office locations since their service is highly customized and often requires in-person work with users. However, Being Seen has a focus on the GTA and can scale to any location in the world since merchants/donors/youths can be in different countries.

3.  **Samaritan ([https://www.samaritan.city/](https://www.samaritan.city/))**
    Samaritan is an organization that seeks to connect donors to homeless individuals. They are similar in the sense that donors can donate to individuals on the platform; however:

- Many homeless people registered on the Samaritan platform dislike the fact that they had to visit staff at a non-profit partner monthly in order to access funds donated to their account. Being Seen has no barriers since money donated to youths go directly to their online account to be spent at any available merchants.
