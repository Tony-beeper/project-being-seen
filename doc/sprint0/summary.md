# Summary

### Part 1: Project Objective

Our vision is to build a systematic online platform that can bridge merchants, donors, and homeless youth together effectively. The website allows donors to directly donate money towards helping homeless youth achieve their goals and satisfy their needs. Homeless youth can also upload their stories and access education and employment assistance.

### Part 2: Key Personas / Users

- Mike Wazowski: A 20 year old youth who has been homeless for over a year. He has big dreams of attending community college and pursuing his dreams of becoming an electrician. He resides in the York Region Community Shelter after losing his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This youth needs assistance in acquiring a new job and donations to possibly fund his education plan.
- Dorothy: a 35 year old financial advisor who met a homeless youth in her local community and was subsequently motivated to donate to improve their lives in the GTA. She wants to make sure that her contribution makes the maximum impact and as much as possible goes directly towards homeless youth to improve their situation.
- James Corden: A 29 year old business owner running a small restaurant who met some homeless youth in his local community and is motivated to improve their lives while boosting his business (in terms of profit and number of customers). He seeks to find an online platform where he can advertise his meals to homeless youths where they can pay him using donations.

### Part 3: Key Scenarios

- Scenario 1: Mike wants to acquire a new job to support himself; however, he is struggling to apply and customize his resume to the positions available despite his strong work ethic and reliability. What Mike needs is access to employment and resume preparation resources (perhaps in the form of an online course) that will help him receive a job.
- Scenario 2: James sees many homeless youth outside his shop who cannot afford meals when needed. He often helps them out with a free meal but wishes that he could help more homeless youth in his community while still making a profit running his restaurant business. James hopes to find a system where he can advertise his meals on an online platform where homeless youth can purchase them from donations they receive. In turn, James will generate more profit while also supporting the homeless youth in his community.
- Scenario 3 - Dorothy recently met a homeless youth in her local community and was subsequently motivated to donate to improve their lives in the GTA. She wants to make sure that her contribution makes the maximum impact and as much as possible goes directly towards homeless youth to improve their situation. She hopes her donation will help the youth access essentials such as food, online courses, etc.

### Part 4: Key Principles (one or two principles to focus on for this project)

- Principle 1 - Prioritize donation system over other features - website should have peer-to-peer donation implemented as first feature even if the other features are not implemented.
- Principle 2 - Provide a platform that can be used by merchants of different types to provide services and products for homeless youth to access.
