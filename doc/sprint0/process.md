# Process

**How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**

- We allocated different sections of the Sprint 0 document to different members of the team.
- The rest of the team would make edits once everyone finished writing up their section over Google Docs.
- We also had discussions on any changes that were being made over Zoom and MS Teams.
- We used Figma to mock up the UI for the website.

**How did you make decisions?**

- Decisions were made by consensus among team members after discussing any proposed change.
- Everyone explained the rationale behind any changes they were proposing before we collectively made a decision as a team.

**How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?**

- By using the Kano Model, all members answer a questionnaire (inspired by the blog post found here: [https://medium.com/@reinaldocamargo/63bc5d28a1fe](https://medium.com/@reinaldocamargo/63bc5d28a1fe)) for each user story and we decide whether the feature falls into the following categories: delightful, desired, required, indifferent, anti-feature, and questionable.
- Questions were asked as follows for each feature:
  - How would you feel if the feature from the user story was in the website?
  - How would you feel if the feature from the user story WASN'T in the website?
- We conducted 2-3 rounds of voting on average to fall into the same categories.

**How frequently did you meet?**

- We met every other day to discuss everyoneâ€™s progress as well as propose changes over Zoom.
- Any additional communication between these times was done over MS Teams.

**What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**

- For our future sprints, we will have scheduled meetings (3 times a week) to ensure a more consistent schedule for everyone.
- We will continue to actively communicate through MS Teams and meet over Zoom as needed.
- We will continue to perform consensus-based decision making as well as spread out the work among team members as it was very successful this sprint.
